            <h2>Applying</h2>
            <p class="lead">Submitting a proposal is a simple as telling us the team members you're putting forward, answering a series of brief questions about them, and providing a fixed price for the duration of the opportunity.</p>
            <h3>Shortlisting</h3>
            <p class="lead">To shortlist proposals, answers to the questions are scored blindly (that means the evaluators can't see the identity of the companies who submitted the answers). Dependent on the spread of resulting scores, the evaluation committee decides how many proposals to shortlist. Once they decide, the app reveals which companies made it onto the shortlist.</p>
            <p class="lead">You'll be notified right away so you can know if your team was shortlisted or not.</p>
            <h3>Code Challenge</h3>
            <p class="lead">If your team is shortlisted, they'll complete a code challenge to demonstrate their technical capability and ability to organize as a team.</p>
            <p class="lead">Code challenges are designed to require about 2 days of effort for a small development team. Your team will have 4 days.</p>
            <p class="lead"><a href="">See an example Code Challenge ></a></p>
            <h3>Team Scenario</h3>
            <p  class="lead">Lastly, as long as your team passes the code challenge with the minimum score, they'll meet with the evaluation panel to answer questions about their work during the code challenge, then take part in a mock sprint planning session with the product owner and scrum master to add features to the product.</p>
